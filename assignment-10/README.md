Here is one [screenshot](./images/assignment10-screenshot1.png), and the other [screenshot](./images/assignment10-screenshot2.png) from this week. 

1. Universal selectors will style *every* element on a page. The elemental selector is when you need to select all the elements in a certain type. Class selectors are used when you select elements that serve the same function. And id selectors are similar to class selectors and let you define elements by a specific id. All of these have their own purpose and it's important to use them accordingly. For example, if you just want to style elements with some function, you would use the class selector and **not** the universal selector. 


2. For my color palette this week, I decided to choose one of my favorite paintings. I ended up using *Irises* by Vincent Van Gogh. To get the colors, I put the image into Adobe Color and found the colors I wanted.
