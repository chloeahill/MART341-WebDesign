                Poem for My Love
            </h2>
                <p>
                    How do we come to be here next to each other <br /> 
                    in the night <br />
                    Where are the stars that show us to our love <br />  
                    inevitable <br />
                    Outside the leaves flame usual in darkness <br />   
                    and the rain <br />
                    falls cool and blessed on the holy flesh <br /> 
                    the black men waiting on the corner for  <br />
                    a womanly mirage <br />
                    I am amazed by peace <br />
                    It is this possibility of you <br />
                    asleep <br />
                    and breathing in the quiet air

            <h2>
                About the Poet
            </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most widely-published and highly-acclaimed Jamaican American 
                    writers of her generation, poet, playwright and essayist June Jordan was 
                    known for her fierce commitment to human rights and political activism. 
                    Over a career that produced twenty-seven volumes of poems, essays, libretti, 
                    and work for children, Jordan engaged the fundamental struggles of her era: 
                    for civil rights, women’s rights, and sexual freedom. A prolific writer 
                    across genres, Jordan’s poetry is known for its immediacy and accessibility 
                    as well as its interest in identity and the representation of personal, lived 
                    experience—her poetry is often deeply autobiographical. Jordan’s work also 
                    frequently imagines a radical, globalized notion of solidarity amongst the 
                    world’s marginalized and oppressed. In volumes like Some Changes (1971), 
                    Living Room (1985) and Kissing God Goodbye: Poems 1991-1997 (1997), Jordan 
                    uses conversational, often vernacular English to address topics ranging from 
                    family, bisexuality, political oppression, racial identity and racial 
                    inequality, and memory. Regarded as one of the key figures in the mid-century 
                    American social, political and artistic milieu, Jordan also taught at many of 
                    the country’s most prestigious universities including Yale, State University 
                    of New York-Stony Brook, and the University of California-Berkeley, where 
                    she founded Poetry for the People. Her honors and awards included fellowships 
                    from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Massachusetts Council on the 
                    Arts, and the New York Foundation for the Arts, a Rockefeller Foundation 
                    grant, and the National Association of Black Journalists Award.
