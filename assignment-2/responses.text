1. A directory is a path that refers to the nesting of folders. With files, directories show how they are organized in folders. 

2. VCS can be very useful. It can track changes made, can revert back to a previous version of a file, and is easy to share and collaborate on.

3. I have a lot of mediums I enjoy. I really like traditional art and water color painting. But I also like after effects and photoshop.
