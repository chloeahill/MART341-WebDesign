                Hi there! My name is Chloe Hill and I'm from Red Lodge, Montana. 
                This is where I grew up before moving to Missoula, Montana to attend
                the University of Montana. Here I am going to school for Media Arts while
                also minoring in Business Administration. I'll be graduating fall 2023 
                and I can't wait to start working in my field! 
                <br />
                <br />
                When I was younger and still living in Red Lodge, I started to learn how to 
                cook and bake. It became a fun way to spend time with friends and family. And who 
                doesn't like having yummy food? Now I live in Missoula with my girlfriend. Even 
                though we have a tiny little kitchen, we still cook and bake a lot. All the recipes 
                on this website are ones we have made despite being on a student budget and living 
                in a small apartment. Some of these recipes call for equipment that I know not everyone 
                has, but these tools are not mandatory and can made differently. And with that, I hope 
                you enjoy the recipes!
