                <li>1 lb flank steak, <em>cut into very thin bite-sized strips</em></li>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil <em>(I like to mix a little sesame oil for flavor as well)</em></li>
                <li>1 lb broccoli, <em>cut into roughly 6 cups of florets</em></li>
                <li><em>Optional -</em> 2 tsp sesame seeds</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Stir Fry Sauce Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>1 tsp fresh ginger, <em>grated</em></li>
                <li>2 tsp minced garlic, <em>roughly 3 cloves</em></li>
                <li>1/2 cup hot water</li>
                <li>6 tbsp low sodium soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tbsp packed light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp corn starch</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tbsp sesame oil <em>(If you added sesame oil to cook the beef and broccoli, 
                    I would recommend using <strong>1 tbsp</strong> here!</em></li>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Cook your write rice so it's all ready to go when the rest of the food is done.
                I would also recommend putting the steak in the freezer for about 30 minutes before so slicing it is easier,
                but this isn't mandatory. </li>
                <li>Combine all of the Stir Fry Sauce ingredients togethe in a small bowl. 
                Make sure all the ingredients are dissolved and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Grab a <strong>large</strong> skillet and place it over medium heat. Add roughly 1 tbsp of oil.</li>
                <li>Once oil is hot, add the broccoli and sauté for 4-5 minutes. Cook until it is bright green and slightly tender. 
                Then remove broccoli from the pan. 
                <em>If you like your broccoli more soft, add about 2 tbsp of water to the skillet.</em>
                </li>
                <li>Increase the heat to high and add remaining oil. Once that is hot, add the sliced steak in a single layer.
                Cook the beef for about 2 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.
                </li>
                <li>Once the meat is cook, reduce the heat to medium/low. Add the sauce and simmer for about 3-4 minutes, or until it thickens.
                Add broccoli and stir it all together. 
                </li>
                <li>Serve over white rice and enjoy!</li>

                <li><strong>Prep:</strong> If you buy noodles that need to be prepared 
                    before assembling the lasanga, do this now. If not, you can move onto the 
                    next step.</li>
                <li>In a large pot over medium high heat, add the oil and sauté the diced onions

                <li>Once garlic is fragrant, add the ground beef. Cook until brown and then 
                    drain out the fat.</li>
                <li>Add the stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and seasonings. Mix until well combined 
                    and let simmer for at least 20 minutes, but can be for as long as you like.</li>
                <li>While the sauce is simmering, add the ricatta and mozzarella to a large bowl. Set aside until 
                    you are ready to prepare the lasagna.</li>
                <li>Once you are ready to assemble your lasagna, first <strong>preheat</strong> the oven to 350<sup>o</sup> F. 
                    Then grease a very large baking dish.</li>
                <li>To layer the lasagna, first place a layer of sauce, then add a layer noodles, and finally a layer 
                    of the cheese mixture. Repeat this until your final layer, which will be just sauce and cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour, covered. Then bake for 10 minutes, uncovered.</li>
                <li>Once noodles are cooked and the cheese is golden, remove from the oven and let sit for several minutes.

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Prepare the rice noodles as instructed on the package.
                Once they are cooked, and have cooled, chop them to be about 1-inch pieces and 
                place in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium/high heat, add 1 tbsp oil and sauté the pork 
                until completely cooked. Move the pork to the bowl with noodles.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, add 2 tbsp oil and sauté the diced onions and shredded carrots.
                Cook until soft. Then, add the cabbage and cook just until wilted <em>(about 2 minutes)</em>.
                Transfer veggies to the bowl with the pork and noodles.</li>
                <li>Season the pork, noodle, and veggie mixture with black pepper, soy sauce, sesame oil, and salt to taste.
                Mix until fully combined and add anything more to taste.</li>
                <li>On a clean surface, lay out 1 egg roll wrapper in a diamond shape.
                Add about 1/4 cup of mixture onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Fold the bottom corner <em>over</em>
                the filling and tuck it. Then roll the covered mixture titghtly towards the center and fold in the sides.
                add a little water to the top corner of the wrapper and finish rolling it to seal. Place the egg roll aside 
                and repeat till mixture is gone.</li>
                <li><strong>Preheat</strong> the air fryer to 400<sup>o</sup> F. Place egg rolls in without layering them. If 
                you want, lightly coat in oil and cook the egg rolls for about 6 minutes or until golden and crispy.
                Flip and repeat until crispy on both sides. Set the cooked egg rolls aside and repeat until all egg rolls are cooked.</li>
