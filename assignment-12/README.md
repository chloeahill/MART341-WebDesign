1. What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?
    - Padding is the amount of space between the content in an element and the element itself. 
    - Margin is the space between the element and other elements.
    - Borders surround an element. They can be styled in many ways, but can often be a line around an element. 
2. Optional: how did this week's assignment go? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
    - Overall, the assignment for this week went well! I did struggle a little with the formatting for the dropdown menu, but I just went through and messed with my css until I was able to find what was making it finicky. 

Here are the screenshots for this week.
