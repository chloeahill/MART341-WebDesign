1. Here is my [screenshot](./images/assignment-05-screenshot.png) for this week. 

2. I ended up visiting YouTube with the Wayback Machine. I went to the date December 1, 2007. Overall, it was very different that YouTube is now. In 2007, it had all the videos lined up as opposed to the more grid like design YouTube has today. Also, instead of having any information on the videos, it is all beside it. For example, today you can see the duration of a video on it in the bottom right corner. Before, it would be written out along with any other information about the video. The website as a whole did flow as well together as it does today.
