            The Song of Achilles is an adaotion of the Illiad by Homer and 
            is told in Patroclus' perspective. The book focuses on his relationship 
            with Achilles starting with their first interactions to their time
            during the Trojan War.

            This book is wonderfully written and I would recommend it to anyone 
            looking for something new to read. It tells a beautiful story, but will
            leave you sobbing by the end.
