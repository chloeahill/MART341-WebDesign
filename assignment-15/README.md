1. How did your user testing sessions go?
    -  The user testing went really well! I really liked a lot of the feedback I got and it helped to have fresh eyes looking at my website. 

2. What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
    - The only changes I made with the feedback so far was some edits to my little bio on the home page. I want to add some more features that the people from the tests suggested, but I wanted to put more time into it and have it done for the final draft. 

3. Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
    - The main thing I struggled with was some formating. The biggest one was trying to get the text and image for my bio to be side by side. I was finally able to do it after some googling, but I couldn't get the border to do what I wanted and I ended up just taking the border off. I still like how it looks, but it's not exactly what I imagined.
