            On the other pages will be recipes my mom has given me. 
        </p>

            The first recipe is Chicken Tortilla Soup. 
            This soup is a constant dinner recipe in my family and is perfect for when you don't have a lot 
            of time to cook. It's a fairly easy soup recipe that doesn't need a lot of tending to. It's not spicy, 
            but can definetly be made spicier if you want. Makes great left overs and is perfect to take for lunches if you need. 
            The soup is good on its own, but can be even better by adding toppings! It's up to you, but I like to add avocado,
            cheese, lime juice, and, of course, tortilla chips. 
        </p>

            The next recipe is Chocolate Chip Cookies. 
            This recipe has been passed down in my family. They make delicious cookies and are great fresh 
            out of the oven with a glass of milk. These cookies are surprisingly easy to make and are a perfect 
            treat for whenever you want. A fun way to upgrade these cookies is by making a much bigger cookie, 
            using about the amount of dough for 4 cookies, baking it, and putting ice cream on it before you eat it! 
            You can use any ice cream you like. This is also good with chocolate syrup and caramal sauce.

            Before coming to live in Missoula while going to school at the University of Montana, I lived
            with my mom in Red Lodge, Montana. I was born and raised in Red Lodge before moving to Missoula. 
            Now I've been living in Missoula for 4 years and will be graduating from UM this upcoming Fall 2023. 
            I live with my girlfriend in a little apartment that has an even littlier kitchen. Despite having a tiny 
            kitchen, we still love to cook and bake. The two recipes above are made constantly and enjoyed. They 
            bring memories of home and being with family.

            Below is a short video showing Red Lodge and nearby views. Red Lodge is a small town an hour away from 
            Billings, Montana. Just about 30 minutes from Red Lodge is the Beartooth Pass, and following the pass is 
            the Cooke City entrance to Yellowstone Park. Along with this, there is Red Lodge Mountain Ski Resort about 
            15 minutes from the town.
