Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. 
What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
- Overall I've really enjoyed learning HTML. A lot of what we've covered this semester so far has been new for me. I have covered some of the topics in previous classes, but I feel like it's finally clicking! I definitly used to struggle with a lot of the stuff I feel more confident in doing now. 


After we come back from spring break we will start to dive into CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
- I'm really excited to learn more about CSS and styling. I'm not sure if there is any one thing I'm most excited for, I'm just glad to be learning more about styling a website in general.
